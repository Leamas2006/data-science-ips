The purpose of this report is to identify areas that require improvement and propose actionable recommendations to increase efficiency.\n\n**Audit Findings:**\n\n1.  **Manually Data Entry In Workforce Management System**: The IT team observes that data entry for the workforce management system appears to be inefficient. It takes an average of 5 minutes per employee, resulting in a total of 5 hours each day.\n2.  **Multiple Approval Steps For Purchase Requests:**\n    *   There are multiple approval steps for purchase requests (department head, finance manager, procurement officer).\n    *   Due to this lengthy process, an average of 3 working days is required to authorize the purchase requests by users.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Automation Of Workforce Management System**\n    *   Implement a system that allows for automatic data import from relevant sources (e.g., employee database).\n    *   The estimated time saved each day as a result of automation would be around 5 hours.\n2.  **Digitalize Approval Process For Purchase Requests**\n    *   Use online platforms providing digitized approval processes with real-time updates.\n    *   This streamlined process cuts down the processing time, bringing it to merely a few minutes instead of days.\n\n**Budgetary Impact:**\n\n1.  Implementation of workforce management system automation would require an estimated investment to be 200$. The payback period for this is estimated at 1 month given the savings generated.\n2.  For digitalizing approval process for purchase requests, our team determines that adopting online platforms providing digitized approval processes with real-time updates will cost approximately $400. This should yield cost savings equivalent to about $50 monthly, contributing a short payback period for this project.\n\n**Implementation Timeline:**\n\n*   Weeks 1-4 ( Automation): Define and implement automation solution.\n    *   Conduct user acceptance testing to guarantee the functionality works seamlessly for everyone involved in it without requiring extra time outside regular business hours because their workday overlaps significantly enough already!\n*   Weeks 5-8 (Streamlining): Set up an online platform that streamlines the process while also adding more efficiency.\n    *   This plan accounts for any eventualities such as last-minute changes or issues arising from users' adaptations during training periods which might impact productivity.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nFrom these observations and analysis, we highly recommend implementing automation in workforce management systems along with digitizing purchase request approvals. These suggested improvements not only lead to direct time advantages but also provide a long term effect due reduced manual task requirements thus minimizing chances of errors over time allowing organizations achieve maximum productive operations efficiently within existing resources available without over investing budget on multiple fronts covering various needs simultaneously!"
